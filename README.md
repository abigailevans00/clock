## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This was a JavaScript30 challenge. I created const variables, a function, and used the DOM to program a working real-time clock.
The project also taught me built-in JS methods.


### Continued development

I would like to improve my understanding of Vanilla Javascript.
